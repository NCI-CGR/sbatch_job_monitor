# sbatch_job_monitor

## Brief Summary

sbatch interface for "plco-analysis" project

## Overview

This README is an automated stub generated from a `cookiecutter` template.
Documentation below reflects the state of the templated project immediately
after creation and may not reflect the current state of the project after
development updates.

## Requirements

  - g++ >= 8.2.0
  - automake/autoconf
  - make >= 4.2
  - git >= 2.28.0
  - nodejs (for commitizen)
  - pre-commit
  - associated linting tools for C++: cppcheck, clang-format
  - [boost headers](https://www.boost.org)
  - [boost program_options](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/doc/html/program_options.html)

## Build

By default, a build process involving a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment is supported.

  - if you wish to use `conda` and it's not currently available, you can install it with the instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
  - navigate into your project directory (sbatch_job_monitor)
  - create the `conda` environment for installation as follows:
  
     `conda env create -f environment.yaml`
  - activate the conda environment:
  
     `conda activate sbatch_job_monitor-env`
  - (one time only per environment) install `commitizen`:
  
     `npm install -g commitizen cz-conventional-changelog`
  - (one time only per environment) install `pre-commit` linters:
  
     `pre-commit install`

  - update (create) the necessary `configure` scripts with `autoreconf`:
  
     `autoreconf --force --install`
	 
     - note that this can also be run with `./generate.bash` inside the repo
  - run `configure`:
  
	 `./configure --with-boost=/path/to/miniconda3/envs/sbatch_job_monitor-env --with-boost-libdir=/path/to/miniconda3/envs/sbatch_job_monitor-env/lib`

	 - if you are planning on installing software to a local directory, run instead `./configure --prefix=/install/dir [...]`
	 - periodically there are some incompatibility issues between `configure` and `conda`. if so, you may need to override
	   some default locations detected by `configure`. for example, you might override the detected compiler with:
	   `CC=gcc CXX=g++ ./configure [...]`
  - run `make CPPFLAGS=""`
	 - this is a non-standard `make` invocation. the reason this is included is because the project
	   is configured to specifically use a `boost` installation in the accompanying `conda` environment.
	   if you'd rather remove `boost` from the conda environment, or ignore it in favor of a system-wide
	   `boost` installation, you can adjust the appropriate `configure` parameters accordingly
	   and instead invoke `make` without any further variable overrides

  - if desired, run `make install`. if permissions issues are reported, see above for reconfiguring with `./configure --prefix`.
     - as above, if you run installation without compiling first, you will again need to override `CPPFLAGS`
	   as follows: `make CPPFLAGS="" check`
  
## Usage

By default, the final compiled program can be run with

`./sbatch_job_monitor.out`
